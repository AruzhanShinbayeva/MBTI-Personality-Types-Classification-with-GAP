# MBTI Personality Types Classification Using Graph ML

## Project idea

The Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) is a popular personality assessment tool that categorizes individuals into 16 distinct personality types based on four dichotomies: Extraversion (E) vs. Introversion (I), Sensing (S) vs. Intuition (N), Thinking (T) vs. Feeling (F), and Judging (J) vs. Perceiving (P). 

The goal of this project is to classify individuals into their respective MBTI personality types using Graph Machine Learning techniques, leveraging social network data and textual content.

## Dataset

[Twitter MBTI Personality Types Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sanketrai/twitter-mbti-dataset/data)

The dataset contains information about 8,328 users, their MBTI personality types in the profile description and their social media posts. It includes features such as user ID, personality type (e.g., ENTP, ENFP), the content of the publication (text) and their subscriptions.


We chose this dataset because it contains a wealth of textual content and social interactions, making it a perfect candidate for applying graph machine learning techniques. This dataset allows us to examine the relationship between social network interactions and personality traits, providing valuable insights into personality analysis and social network research.
